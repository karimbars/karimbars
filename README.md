- Hi, I’m @karimbars
- 👀 I’m interested in growing my understanding of computer science, and bringing that knowledge into my daily life
- I want to expand my capabilities on a computer, to put it simply. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning through the edX CS50x course, and learning Python separately. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I want to work on hardware/software integration and software automation.
